# Orientation
- Top: Ledge (Blocking), Sign (Obsticle) - I can't move much up. There is a Sign that cannot passed from down to up.
- Bottom: High Grass (Traversable), Fence (Obsticle) - I could go back down but this would be against my goals of reaching the next city in the north.
- Right: High Grass (Traverseable) - I could go in this direction. However I would likely not be able to go further up.
- Left: High Grass (Traversable) - I can go in this direction. I should go left to go around the Sign.
