# Orientation
- Top: Trees (Obsticle) - I can't move much up. There are Trees that are blocking the way.
- Bottom: High Grass (Traversable), Sign (Obsticle), Fence (Obsticle) - I could go back down but this would be against my goals of reaching the next city in the north.
- Right: Grass (Traversable), High Grass (Traverseable) - I should go in this direction first so I can go further through the high grass.
- Left: Grass (Traversable) - I can go in this direction. However I would likely not be able to go further up.
