- Bottom:  Plant (Obsticle) - There is a plant at the bottom.
- Right: Wall / Black Space (Obsticle) - I can't move far to the right. There is a wall blocking the way.
- Left: Desk (Obsticle) - I could move to the left, however, my goal is to leave the house. Therefore I should try to reach the warp in the top of the map instead.
